# Snake_Game
### *This is a fully working snake game that is made in JAVA using swing and Ms Access !!!* 
### *This is a recreation of the simple snake game and has all the same game mechanics. A game loop/cycle has been implemented to make the movement of the player controled snake much more smooth. You can move the snake using arrow keys and as soon as the snake's head touches the apple 10 points will be count and snake size increase by 1 dot . If the snake touches the frame boundary the game will over.*
